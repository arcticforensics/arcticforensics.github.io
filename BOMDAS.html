          <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1em;">BODMAS is an acronym that stands for
            Bracket, Of, Division, Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction. In
            certain regions, PEDMAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Division,
            Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction) is the synonym of BODMAS.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1em;">It explains the order of operations to
            solve an expression. According to Bodmas rule, if an expression
            contains brackets ((), {}, []) we have to first solve or simplify
            the bracket followed by of (powers and roots etc.), then division,
            multiplication, addition and subtraction from left to right. Solving
            the problem in the wrong order will result in a wrong answer.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1em;">Note: The “of” in the BODMAS full form
            is also called “Order”, which refers to the numbers which involve
            powers, square roots, etc.</p>
