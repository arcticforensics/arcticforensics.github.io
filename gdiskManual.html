<h1>Name</h1>

<p>gdisk - Interactive GUID partition table (GPT) manipulator
<h1>Synopsis</h1>

<p><b>gdisk</b> [ -s sector_size ] <i>device_file</i>
<h1>Description</h1>


<p>GPT fdisk (aka <b>gdisk</b>) is a text-mode menu-driven program for creation and manipulation of partition tables. It
    will automatically convert an
    old-style Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table or BSD disklabel stored without an MBR carrier partition to the
    newer Globally Unique Identifier (GUID)
    Partition Table (GPT) format, or will load a GUID partition table. When used with the <i>-l</i> command-line option,
    the program displays the current partition
    table and then exits.
<p>GPT fdisk operates mainly on the GPT headers and partition tables; however, it can and will generate a fresh
    protective MBR, when required. (Any boot loader
    code in the protective MBR will not be disturbed.) If you've created an unusual protective MBR, such as a hybrid MBR
    created by <b>gptsync</b> or
    <b>gdisk</b>'s own hybrid MBR creation feature, this should not be disturbed by most ordinary actions. Some advanced
    data recovery options require you to
    understand the distinctions between the main and backup data, as well as between the GPT headers and the partition
    tables. For information on MBR vs. GPT, as
    well as GPT terminology and structure, see the extended <b>gdisk</b> documentation at <a
        href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/">http://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/</a> or consult Wikipedia.

<p>The <b>gdisk</b> program employs a user interface similar to that of Linux's <b>fdisk</b>, but <b>gdisk</b> modifies
    GPT partitions. It also has the
    capability of transforming MBR partitions or BSD disklabels into GPT partitions. Like the original <b>fdisk</b>
    program, <b>gdisk</b> does not modify disk
    structures until you explicitly write them to disk, so if you make a mistake, you can exit from the program with the
    'q' option to leave your partitions
    unmodified.
<p>Ordinarily, <b>gdisk</b> operates on disk device files, such as <i>/dev/sda</i> or <i>/dev/hda</i> under Linux,
    <i>/dev/disk0</i> under Mac OS X, <i>\\.\physicaldrive0</i> under Windows, or
    <i>/dev/ad0</i> or <i>/dev/da0</i> under FreeBSD. The program can also operate on disk image files, which can be
    either copies of whole disks (made with
    <b>dd</b>, for instance) or raw disk images used by emulators such as QEMU or VMWare. Note that only <i>raw</i> disk
    images are supported; <b>gdisk</b> cannot
    work on compressed or other advanced disk image formats.
<p>The MBR partitioning system uses a combination of cylinder/head/sector (CHS) addressing and logical block addressing
    (LBA). The former is klunky and
    limiting. GPT drops CHS addressing and uses 64-bit LBA mode exclusively. Thus, GPT data structures, and therefore
    <b>gdisk</b>, do not need to deal with CHS
    geometries and all the problems they create. Users of <b>fdisk</b> will note that <b>gdisk</b> lacks the options and
    limitations associated with CHS
    geometries.
<p>For best results, you should use an OS-specific partition table program whenever possible. For example, you should
    make Mac OS X partitions with the Mac OS
    X Disk Utility program and Linux partitions with the Linux <b>gdisk</b> or GNU Parted program.
<p>Upon start, <b>gdisk</b> attempts to identify the partition type in use on the disk. If it finds valid GPT data,
    <b>gdisk</b> will use it. If <b>gdisk</b>
    finds a valid MBR or BSD disklabel but no GPT data, it will attempt to convert the MBR or disklabel into GPT form.
    (BSD disklabels are likely to have unusable
    first and/or final partitions because they overlap with the GPT data structures, though.) GPT fdisk can identify,
    but not use data in, Apple Partition Map
    (APM) disks, which are used on 680x0- and PowerPC-based Macintoshes.
<p>Some OSes' GPT utilities create some blank space (typically 128 MiB) after each partition. The intent is to enable
    future disk utilities to use this space.
    Such free space is not required of GPT disks, but creating it may help in future disk maintenance. You can use GPT
    fdisk's relative partition positioning
    option (specifying the starting sector as '+128M', for instance) to simplify creating such gaps.

<h2>Options</h2>
<dl compact>
    <b>i</b>

        <p>Show detailed partition information. The summary information produced by the 'p' command necessarily omits
            many details, such as the partition's unique GUID
            and the translation of <b>gdisk</b>'s internal partition type code to a plain type name. The 'i' option
            displays this information for a single partition.

        <p><b>l</b>

        <p>Display a summary of partition types. GPT uses a GUID to identify partition types for particular OSes and
            purposes. For ease of data entry, <b>gdisk</b>
            compresses these into two-byte (four-digit hexadecimal) values that are related to their equivalent MBR
            codes. Specifically, the MBR code is multiplied by
            hexadecimal 0x0100. For instance, the code for Linux swap space in MBR is 0x82, and it's 0x8200 in
            <b>gdisk</b>. A one-to-one correspondence is impossible,
            though. Most notably, the codes for all varieties of FAT and NTFS partition correspond to a single GPT code
            (entered as 0x0700 in <b>sgdisk</b>). Some OSes use
            a single MBR code but employ many more codes in GPT. For these, <b>gdisk</b> adds code numbers sequentially,
            such as 0xa500 for a FreeBSD disklabel, 0xa501 for
            FreeBSD boot, 0xa502 for FreeBSD swap, and so on. Note that these two-byte codes are unique to <b>gdisk</b>.

        <p><b>p</b>

        <p>Display basic partition summary data. This includes partition numbers, starting and ending sector numbers,
            partition sizes, <b>gdisk</b>'s partition types
            codes, and partition names. For additional information, use the 'i' command.

        <p><b>q</b>

        <p>Quit from the program <i>without saving your changes</i>. Use this option if you just wanted to view
            information or if you make a mistake and want to back
            out of all your changes.

        <p><b>v</b>

        <p>Verify disk. This option checks for a variety of problems, such as incorrect CRCs and mismatched main and
            backup data. This option does not automatically
            correct most problems, though; for that, you must use options on the recovery &amp; transformation menu. If
            no problems are found, this command displays a
            summary of unallocated disk space.

        <p><b>?</b>

        Print the menu. Type this command (or any other unrecognized command) to see a summary of available options.
    The second <b>gdisk</b> menu is the recovery &amp; transformation menu, which provides access to data recovery
        options and features related to the
        transformation of partitions between partitioning schemes (converting BSD disklabels into GPT partitions or
        creating hybrid MBRs, for instance). A few options
        on this menu duplicate functionality on the main menu, for the sake of convenience. The options on this menu
        are:
